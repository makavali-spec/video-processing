# Video Processing with TensorFlow and PyTorch
This project demonstrates video processing and machine learning tasks using both TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. The project includes functionalities for preprocessing frames, performing video processing, extracting features, training machine learning models, and evaluating model performance.

# Features
Preprocessing Frames: Convert frames to grayscale, resize to 256x256, and normalize pixel values.
Video Processing: Calculate the mean frame of a video using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Augmentation: Simulate data augmentation by flipping frames horizontally.
Feature Extraction: Extract features (histograms) from frames using multi-threading.
Machine Learning Models: Train models (dense neural network with TensorFlow or convolutional neural network with PyTorch) for video analysis tasks.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
